# Prediction of Readmission at Hospitals using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithms
This project aims to predict the readmissions at hospitals by analyzing the diabetes data factors that related to readmission classes using sklearn, machine learning libraries. Performed data preparation steps including missing values check, data cleaning, label encoder, feature scaling - standardization. Moreover, utilized the algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting to find the best techniques by applying class imbalance such as SMOTE, Random Oversampling, NearMiss and feature selection namely SelectFromModel, Recursive Feature Elimination Cross-Validated, Recursive Feature Elimination. Furthermore, the comparisons have been performed on different algorithms to know the metrics in a better way. Algorithms and techniques have been applied using python and machine learning repositories. Also, performed visualizations for better understanding.


The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the U.S agency which has initiated numerous programs to ameliorate the patientâ€™s health. One of the programs is Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), a value-based purchase program that motivates the hospitals to enhance the care and communication between caregivers and patients to lessen the needless readmissions. Unfortunately, most of the patients who are readmitted and hospitalized have diabetes. Hence, the aim is to predict the readmissions of patients having diabetes so that it could be helpful in reducing the readmission rates. Unfortunately, it will not be effective to analyse the whole data by the humans to predict the values after understanding the relation between readmission and other features. Hence, here comes the use of machine learning. Machine learning helps to predict the values based on the historical data. For this data, predictive modeling can be applied which helps in prioritizing the patients according to the diagnosis and severity.
